#Task 05: Cryptanalysis v1

##Description
Program read the input.txt file, perform my custom four-step ciphering and 
save it as an awesome emoji ciphered text to the output.txt file.

For now, I'm keeping the "input.txt" and the "secret.py" files in gitignore so to not spoil the fun of my colleagues

##Requirements

Try to come up with your own cipher:

a) substitutional, monoalphabetic or

b) homophonic (max 3 substitutions per character)

c) column transposition

d) poem transposition

e) the code "accepts" the English alphabet

f) Spaces may or may not stay

Encrypt the English text 1000-2000 characters long and send it as an attachment for this task.
In a week's time we'll have a cipher-breaking contest.
