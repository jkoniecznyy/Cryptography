Task 07: Blockchain

Description

Implement your own blockchain network similar to the links presented in the lecture.

The news can be about anything: financial world, your own budget, or even the collection of postage stamps.
Make sure that it is a full-fledged project easy to use for the average person (so the basic frontend will be useful).
Add API to perform transactions, get wallet status, network status, number of blocks in a chain, etc.

Optional
Add interesting graphics and come up with your "shitcoin".
