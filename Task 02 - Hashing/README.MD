Exercise 2: hash functions

1. Implement function hashing with functions returned by algorithms_available from
hashlib library along with returning hash time information for input data from the console.

2. Download a large file (eg Ubuntu) and check if the hash is correct.

3. Implement an option that hashes any binary file from disk. Check it by hashing
Ubuntu image from point 2.

4. Use the timeit package to test the speed of hash generation for messages of different sizes.
Graph it using matplotlib (less recommended) or plotly (recommended).
