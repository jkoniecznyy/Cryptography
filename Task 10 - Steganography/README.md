Exercise 10: Steganography

Design and write a steganography program:

with a graphical interface (web or desktop)

that allows you to "hide" text using an image in any graphic format (hint: some are simpler than others)

that allows you to "read" the text hidden in the picture (we assume the same scheme and algorithm)

that allows you to encrypt the text with any algorithm (does not have to be your own, but it can)
