Exercise 01: Warming up

On 3:
1. In any programming language, do Caesar and Vigenere (optional) encoder and decryptor.
The console version is enough. It would be nice if there was some nice API, input validation,
automatic tests.

On 4:
1. Perform a manual Caesar cipher breaker.

On 5:
1. Perform an automatic Caesar cipher breaker.

Assumptions for tasks on 4 and 5 : 

1. The alphabet is ASCI.

2. The plain text is in English.

3. Don't overdo the length of a plaintext.

4. Code quality also matters. So comments, clean code and SOLID rules,
unit testing, data validation and stuff.
